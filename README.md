## Background:
Our goal was to develop a gradebook software to assist educators in managing and tracking both student academic performance and individual module performance. 
The EduTech Toolbox helps educators easily track students' progress and identify areas where they may need additional support. By using this information, educators can make informed decisions regarding necessary changes and adjustments to various modules, which can help personalize the learning experience and enhance student performance. <br>
Ultimately, our aim is to provide educators with the necessary tools to make data-driven decisions to positively influence the learning outcomes and experience of students. 

## About:
The EduTech Toolbox application is designed to retrieve and update data from an SQL database to create visualizations and statistics related to student and module performance. The application has two main windows: the Module window and the Student window. The Module window allows users to analyze the performance of a module by providing visualizations and statistics related to the distribution of student grades. It also allows users to compare a student's overall average to the module grade. The Student window is focused on analyzing individual student performance. It provides a list of students ranked by their overall averages, which can be sorted by student ID or rank by the user. Additionally, the Student window offers an in-depth review of each student's performance, including their average, best and worst modules, and rank. <br>
